Each of the following Challenge Pages is from the end of one of the NESMaker 6502 Tutorial Videos I've published to YouTube.

<h2 id="nesmaker">What's this about?</h2>
This is a series of challenges I've designed for use with my Assembly Language Tutorials for the NESMaker community.
[NESMaker](http://www.thenew8bitheroes.com/) is a new game development tool designed to make creating games for the original NES a whole lot easier. While the pitch is making NES games with no coding required, I've found in my own experience that making games without any custom code can lead to things being samey. There were enough people that wanted to learn and couldn't wait for official tutorials, so I decided I'd fill in the hole and see what I could do.
